# Gomoku Desktop Debugger

## Introduction

Life is not easy, especially for SUSTech CS juniors taking CS303 (Artificial Intelligence).

This GUI utility is created to ease the debug process of the Gomoku AI project. You can easily integrate it with your AI code and play with your own AI interactively.

Currently it is poorly-implemented, feature-incomplete, and probably bug-rich.

## Installation

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/ziqin/Gomoku-Debuger.git
cd Gomoku-Debuger
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note that you may need to replace `pip` with `pip3`.
